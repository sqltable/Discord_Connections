# Discord_Connections
With this script you can use a private exploit to create "fake verified" connections.

I would not recommend connecting Discord's official Twitter to your Discord account as it will get you banned!

#How to use
- Extract all the files/folders to your Desktop.
- Run the file "discodiscord_fake_verified_connections.py" & it'll take a couple minutes to load up.

- Once loaded you can put your token in & give it the username you want & pick the social media you want the connection to have
- So if you want to fake having the Steam "d" you could do that & it'll have the verified tick next to it.

Don't know how long this will last. Goodluck.
